# tiktaktoe_variant
A spin on the classic tik tak toe, you play 9 games at once with each game counting as one x or o on the master game.
The rules are the same as normal tiktaktoe with only 3 different rules.
1. 9 games at once plus the higher level game which is the main goal to win. 
   You are playing a game of tik tak toe for each individual square of the larger game
2. Each move you make determines which box on the higher level game the next move must be played in.
   For example:
   If your opponent plays in the bottom left corner of the lower level tiktaktoe your next move must be in the lower 
   left corner of the higher level game
3. There is one exception to rule 2. Iff the higher level square in which your next move must be played is completed, it is the person who won the lower level game in that square    who decides which higher level square the next move should be played in. So this may lead to you deciding where your next move is (which is usually ideal) or your opponent        deciding where your next move is (not so ideal).

Thats it have fun! Hopefully this makes sense. Also forgive the weird game I made this for my gf lol.
